# Project Description

---

**_<p style="font-weight: bold; color: var(--theme-ui-colors-p700);">WELCOME TO MY LAND.</p>_**
This is my personal project, it is a simple website that works as my portfolio for now, I have some ideas or goals that I want to achieve and I think that the best way is to start with myself. I would like this continue advancing and help people who need it with my knowledge.

### Goals

Here are some of the goals that I want to reach with gaboland:

- Made a comunity.
- Create something that help people.
- Create research with new incoming technologies.

### Teachings

This project has left me many teachings with modern technologies, for example, Jamstack, Gatsby, Theme UI. And that is all, for now. I hope continue learning new things for the future.

#### Design process

This was designed with figma and I could implement a complete design system for first time, I had to choose the brand colors, typography, make the components, etc...

#### Development process

In the development proccess was another trip because I had to learn a new react framework ["Gatsbyjs"](https://gatsbyjs.com), learn [theme ui](https://theme-ui.com) and learn how it works a gatsby starter developed by [@lekoarts](https://lekoarts.de).
