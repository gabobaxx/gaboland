# Proccess or description

This is my personal project, it is a simple website that works as my portfolio for now, I have some ideas or goals that I want to achieve and I think that the best way is to start with myself. I would like this continue advancing and help people who need it with my knowledge.
This project has left me many teachings with modern technologies, for example, this was designed with figma and I could implement a complete design system for first time, I had to choose the brand colors, typography, maek the components, etc, etc...
In the development proccess was another trip because I had to learn a new react framework "Gatsby", learn theme ui (it is for styling my app) and learn how it works a Gatsby starter developed by @lekoarts (Thanks to him, gabo.land exists).
And that is all, for now. I hope continue learning new things for the future.
