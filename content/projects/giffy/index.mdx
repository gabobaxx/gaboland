# Project Description

---

This was the first time that I used react for a complete "production" app from zero to deploy it at vercel. It was bootstrapped with create react app, the things I learned here were a perspective change for myself, from there I was able to change my development process with react. I am very grateful to <a href="https://midu.tube">midudev</a> because without him, this development way wouldn't have been possible.

### Goals

This project began as a practice but end up being much more than that, it allowed me to understand how the process of developing a complete application with React works, something that did not have present until that moment.

### Teachings

Giffy has left me many teaching, for example, how can I test react apps, how can I add SEO to a react apps, how hooks are used, test of hooks, performance topic and much more.
